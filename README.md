# Digests
Digests extension for phpBB 3.3

Please note that when deployed the extension will go under ext/phpbbservices/digests. Only the digests tree is shown in GitHub.

If you are upgrading from the digests modification for phpBB 3.0, first read the FAQ on how to retain your digests subscribers: https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extension/digests_extension/faq/2731

Digests no longer requires that a cron job be run hourly, but it's generally a good idea to set up what is known as a "system cron". See https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extension/digests_extension/faq/2716.

After installation, there are recommended steps for testing digests. See: https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extension/digests_extension/faq/2736

Czech, French, German and Spanish language translations exist. The translation may be out of date. Translations must be placed int the extension's language folder /ext/phpbbservices/digests/language, ex: /ext/phpbbservices/digests/language/fr for French. Thanks to our translators for providing these translations!
